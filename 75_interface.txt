1. You can achieve 100 % abstraction, using interfaces.

2. Java doesn't support Multiple - Inheritance using classes

3. Interfaces support Multiple - Inheritance.

4. Interfaces contain only abstract methods

5. You need to write only the declaration of the methods in the interfaces.

6. classes can implement interface using 'implements' keyword.

7. The class that implements an interface should provide concrete implementation of the methods in the interface.

interface MyInterface
{
    methods
}
