We can create variables of 3 different types. (Local, Instance, Static)

Local variables - Inside a class also inside a method. Scope is within the block/ method scope.

Instance variables (non - static) - Inside a class outside the method without static. Belongs to instances of that class. 

Scope - Inside the same class & outside the class with an instance.

Static/ class variables - Inside a class outside a method with static keyword.

Scope - Inside the class, outside the class with classname directly.

Static and Non - Static :-

If you are able to access class members directly by using class name that means those members are static.

If you need to create an instance to access class members then they are non-static or instance.

Note: static members can also be accessed using object.
