INHERITANCE - The mechanism where one class obtains the features from another class.

extends is the keyword we use for inheritance

Super class / Parent class / Base class -> From which ever the class you are obtaining the features

Sub class / Child class / Derived class -> From which ever the class that is obtaining the features

class A extends Z {} -> A => Sub class, Z => Super class

class Student extends Person{} -> Student => Child class, Person => Parent class
 
If you create an instance of a child class the default constructor of parent class is also invoked.

Note - Inheritance -> "is a" relationship
